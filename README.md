# Pomodoro
A Pomodoro Timer Python project implements the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method designed to improve focus and productivity. This project typically involves creating a timer that cycles through focused work intervals (traditionally 25 minutes, known as "pomodoros") and short breaks (e.g., 5 minutes), with longer breaks after a set number of pomodoros.
